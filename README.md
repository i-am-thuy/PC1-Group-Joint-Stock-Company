# PC1- Why PC1 is the long-term choice for your portfolio

PC1 experienced more than 50 years of construction and development national electricity transmission works (wind power today), and real estate.

In the fact of gas prices increasing, which can result in higher buying prices than selling ones, EVN will prioritize finding cheaper alternative energy sources, benefiting wind power producers such as PC1.
Three PC1 wind power projects have been completed and energized before October 31, 2021 in order to take advantage of the FIT price (8.5 cents/kWH) for a period of 20 years.

In 2022, PC1 will develop metal segment - Nikken with the expectation that this segment will increase sharply due to geopolitical tensions between Russia and Ukraine, causing item prices to rise sharply.
